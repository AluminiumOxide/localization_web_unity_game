***
for the reason about github limitations on file size 

you need to download unity3d file in [this link](http://allophane.com/BlackSun/BlackSunFinal.unity3d) and save to the root directory.

I also recommend you crawl this file as what my [blog](http://allophane.com/index.php/2022/02/15/localization_unity_game/) show
